## Project Motivation and Description

As a frequent city traveler, I frequently get the same inquiries while seeking for lodging in a place I haven't been to before. I intended to use the aggregate Airbnb data for a place, in this case Boston, to try to come up with some general recommendations for traveling there. 
1. Which seasons of the year are the most expensive?
2. Which neighborhoods ought you to check out if you want a calmer or livelier experience?
3. What areas should I select if I want to be in the heart of everything?
4. Which areas are ideal for a holiday on a tighter budget?
5. In listings when the host rents more than one room, is the rating different?
6. Is there an overrepresentation of certain neighborhoods for single- and multi-listing         properties?

## File Description
The code to respond to the aforementioned queries is contained in a single Jupyter notebook. The many methods done and the conclusions that might be reached for each question were explained using markdown cells. Additionally, there are 5 csv files: calendar2017.csv, calendar2018.csv, and calendar2019.csv each contain pricing information for each listing per day over the course of a year; reviews2017.csv contains reviews for each listing; and listings2017.csv contains 95 different variables pertaining to more than 3,500 listings on Airbnb in Boston.
